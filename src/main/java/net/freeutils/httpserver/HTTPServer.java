/**
 * The {@code HTTPServer} class implements a light-weight HTTP server.
 * <p>
 * This server implements all functionality required by RFC 2616 ("Hypertext
 * Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"), as well as some of the optional
 * functionality (this is termed "conditionally compliant" in the RFC).
 * In fact, a couple of bugs in the RFC itself were discovered
 * (and fixed) during the development of this server.
 * <p>
 * <b>Feature Overview</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>RFC compliant - correctness is not sacrificed for the sake of size</li>
 * <li>Virtual hosts - multiple domains and subdomains per server</li>
 * <li>File serving - built-in handler to serve files and folders from disk</li>
 * <li>Mime type mappings - configurable via API or a standard mime.types file</li>
 * <li>Directory index generation - enables browsing folder contents</li>
 * <li>Welcome files - configurable default filename (e.g. index.html)</li>
 * <li>All HTTP methods supported - GET/HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/POST/PUT/DELETE/custom</li>
 * <li>Conditional statuses - ETags and If-* header support</li>
 * <li>Chunked transfer encoding - for serving dynamically-generated data streams</li>
 * <li>Gzip/deflate compression - reduces bandwidth and download time</li>
 * <li>HTTPS - secures all server communications</li>
 * <li>Partial content - download continuation (a.k.a. byte range serving)</li>
 * <li>File upload - multipart/form-data handling as stream or iterator</li>
 * <li>Multiple context handlers - a different handler method per URL path</li>
 * <li>@Context annotations - auto-detection of context handler methods</li>
 * <li>Parameter parsing - from query string or x-www-form-urlencoded body</li>
 * <li>A single source file - super-easy to integrate into any application</li>
 * <li>Standalone - no dependencies other than the Java runtime</li>
 * <li>Small footprint - standard jar is ~50K, stripped jar is ~35K</li>
 * <li>Extensible design - easy to override, add or remove functionality</li>
 * <li>Reusable utility methods to simplify your custom code</li>
 * <li>Extensive documentation of API and implementation (&gt;40% of source lines)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Use Cases</b>
 * <p>
 * Being a lightweight, standalone, easily embeddable and tiny-footprint
 * server, it is well-suited for
 * <ul>
 * <li>Resource-constrained environments such as embedded devices.
 *     For really extreme constraints, you can easily remove unneeded
 *     functionality to make it even smaller (and use the -Dstripped
 *     maven build option to strip away debug info, license, etc.)</li>
 * <li>Unit and integration tests - fast setup/teardown times, small overhead
 *     and simple context handler setup make it a great web server for testing
 *     client components under various server response conditions.</li>
 * <li>Embedding a web console into any headless application for
 *     administration, monitoring, or a full portable GUI.</li>
 * <li>A full-fledged standalone web server serving static files,
 *     dynamically-generated content, REST APIs, pseudo-streaming, etc.</li>
 * <li>A good reference for learning how HTTP works under the hood.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation Notes</b>
 * <p>
 * The design and implementation of this server attempt to balance correctness,
 * compliance, readability, size, features, extensibility and performance,
 * and often prioritize them in this order, but some trade-offs must be made.
 * <p>
 * This server is multithreaded in its support for multiple concurrent HTTP
 * connections, however most of its constituent classes are not thread-safe and
 * require external synchronization if accessed by multiple threads concurrently.
 * <p>
 * <b>Source Structure and Documentation</b>
 * <p>
 * This server is intentionally written as a single source file, in order to make
 * it as easy as possible to integrate into any existing project - by simply adding
 * this single file to the project sources. It does, however, aim to maintain a
 * structured and flexible design. There are no external package dependencies.
 * <p>
 * This file contains extensive documentation of its classes and methods, as
 * well as implementation details and references to specific RFC sections
 * which clarify the logic behind the code. It is recommended that anyone
 * attempting to modify the protocol-level functionality become acquainted with
 * the RFC, in order to make sure that protocol compliance is not broken.
 * <p>
 * <b>Getting Started</b>
 * <p>
 * For an example and a good starting point for learning how to use the API,
 * see the {@link #main main} method at the bottom of the file, and follow
 * the code into the API from there. Alternatively, you can just browse through
 * the classes and utility methods and read their documentation and code.
